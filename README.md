TODO: Merge this file with Benjamin branch

## Cooperative files
Our program only works for files given by the professor, available in the Sample Music folder. 

The lo-fi and our clap, for example, do not work.





## ffmpeg
Include the three files in your Current Working Directory (CWD):
```
ffmpeg.exe
ffplay.exe
ffprobe.exe
```
The .zips of these files can be obtained from the following website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

The files from those .zips can be obtained from the bin.
