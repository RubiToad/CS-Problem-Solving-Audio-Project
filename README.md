# Audio Project Group 14
The objective of this program is to load an audio file from someone's computer. It will display a variety of data, along with display plots of wavelength and RT60 values.
# Why was it made?
This project was assigned as a part of my COP2080 CS Problem Solving and Solution Class. It was our final project, where we worked together for a month as an introduction to using GitHub.

## Cooperative files
Our program only works for files given by the professor, available in the Sample Music folder. 

The lo-fi and our clap, for example, do not work.

## ffmpeg
Include the three files in your Current Working Directory (CWD):
```
ffmpeg.exe
ffplay.exe
ffprobe.exe
```
The .zips of these files can be obtained from the following website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

The files from those .zips can be obtained from the bin.
