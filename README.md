## Benjamin(1)
I deleted Benjamin(1) because I had the rest of the venv included, which was unnecessary. Only the .py files should be committed. Furthermore, in that branch, I placed the python modules into the virtual environment, like a dunce!

## ffmpeg
Include the three files in your Current Working Directory (CWD):
```
ffmpeg.exe
ffplay.exe
ffprobe.exe
```
The .zips of these files can be obtained from the following website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

The files from those .zips can be obtained from the bin.
